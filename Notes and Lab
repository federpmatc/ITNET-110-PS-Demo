Turn firewall off
Set-NetFirewallProfile -Enabled False


Home Folders - https://github.com/federpmatc/Capstone-Project-Course/blob/main/HomeFolder.ps1

Short code - make 20 users

What can we learn from this?
PowerShell commands consist of two parts
We see parameters (some consist of values)
Create Folder
Share it and set permissions
Create a bunch of subfolders & assign permissions
Look at NTFS -  #Change permission of C:\Home so that GG_Homefolder group has Read Access to this folder only 
We see that USERS are being inherited
Also, Employees can create folders & subfolders...very bad
Could use View Effective NTFS permissions
We see employee2 can read/write stuff in Employee1
Fix NTFS - Change Users permissions to Folder Only
\\server2016-1\home$ show that Employee1 can access other usersâ€™ stuff
